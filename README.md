## 👁️ What Is Wallhack (ESP)?

ESP (Extrasensory Perception) is a visual overlay that reveals players, items, traps, and map elements through walls and terrain. The Apex wallhack uses internal or external injection to overlay real-time data, giving you **full vision**, even in the most chaotic zones.

You’ll see every enemy before they peek, every squad rotating early, and every loot drop worth chasing.
